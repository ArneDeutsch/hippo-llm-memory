**Gate – PASSED**  
CI config runs lint and tests【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L35】; local lint and tests succeed【282dfc†L1-L5】【43fee3†L1-L11】.

### Milestone 2 – Baseline infrastructure & smoke tests
**WP1 Repository & CI setup – PASSED**  
Makefile and CI ensure ruff/black/pytest on each commit【F:Makefile†L1-L16】【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L26-L35】.

**WP2 Dataset generator – PASSED**  
`scripts/build_datasets.py` deterministically generates JSONL; sample run produced `data/episodic_sample.jsonl` with expected schema【F:scripts/build_datasets.py†L1-L86】【754803†L1-L3】.

**WP3 Evaluation harness – PASSED**  
`scripts/eval_bench.py` dry-run produced metrics and meta files under `runs/dryrun/`【c491d4†L1-L2】【c059d9†L1-L3】.

**WP4 Baseline training wrapper – PARTIAL**  
`scripts/train_lora.py` exists, but dry-run failed to download HuggingFace model due to proxy restrictions【fec1f7†L1-L49】.

**Gate – PASSED**  
Repo builds/tests pass and dataset/eval scripts produce expected artifacts【282dfc†L1-L5】【43fee3†L1-L11】【050971†L1-L2】【a2a0ca†L1-L5】.

### Milestone 3 – Episodic memory (HEI‑NW) prototype
**WP1–WP4 Implementation – PASSED**  
`hippo_mem/episodic/` contains gating, store, replay and adapter modules with k‑WTA encoding, gating threshold and prioritized replay【F:hippo_mem/episodic/gating.py†L1-L76】【F:hippo_mem/episodic/store.py†L1-L77】【F:hippo_mem/episodic/replay.py†L1-L76】【F:hippo_mem/episodic/adapter.py†L1-L77】.

**WP5 Tests – PASSED**  
Unit tests verify one-shot recall, partial-cue retrieval and gating behavior【F:tests/test_episodic.py†L1-L55】; full test suite passes【43fee3†L1-L11】.

**Gate – PASSED**  
Eval harness instantiates episodic module during dry-run【c491d4†L1-L2】.

### Milestone 4 – Relational semantic memory (SGC‑RSS) prototype
**WP1 Tuple extractor & schema index – PASSED**  
`tuples.py` provides heuristic extractor; schema index routes tuples【F:hippo_mem/relational/tuples.py†L1-L68】【F:hippo_mem/relational/schema.py†L1-L40】.

**WP2 Knowledge graph store – PASSED**  
`kg.py` implements NetworkX + SQLite store with embeddings【F:hippo_mem/relational/kg.py†L1-L80】.

**WP3 Relational adapter – PASSED**  
Adapter performs deterministic fusion of KG and episodic features【F:hippo_mem/relational/adapter.py†L1-L32】.

**WP4 Schema routing tests – PASSED**  
Tests confirm extractor precision ≥0.9, multi-hop retrieval and deterministic fusion【F:tests/test_relational.py†L1-L35】【F:tests/test_relational.py†L36-L57】.

**Gate – PASSED**  
Modules present and tests succeed (precision and multi-hop retrieval assertions)【43fee3†L1-L11】.

### Milestone 5 – Spatial & procedural memory (SMPD) prototype
**WP1 PlaceGraph & planner – PASSED**  
`map.py` provides deterministic graph and A*/Dijkstra planning【F:hippo_mem/spatial/map.py†L1-L80】.

**WP2 Macro library – PASSED**  
`macros.py` stores and ranks macros with success-weighted probability【F:hippo_mem/spatial/macros.py†L1-L56】.

**WP3 Spatial adapter – PASSED**  
`adapter.py` implements cross-attention over plans/macros【F:hippo_mem/spatial/adapter.py†L1-L77】.

**WP4 Tests – PASSED**  
Unit tests cover deterministic graph growth, path planning equivalence and macro ranking improvement【F:tests/test_spatial.py†L1-L33】【F:tests/test_spatial.py†L34-L53】.

**Gate – PASSED**  
Eval harness successfully instantiated spatial module, producing metrics【3589cc†L1-L2】.

### Milestone 6 – Consolidation & replay framework
**All work packages – NOT MET**  
Repository lacks scheduler, consolidation worker, and maintenance job implementations; searches for `scheduler` show only planning references in docs【258cd3†L1-L23】.

**Gate – NOT MET**  
No code or logs demonstrating replay-based consolidation runs.

### Milestone 7 – Integration with LLM & ablation-ready training
**WP1 Adapter hookup – PASSED**  
`train_lora.py` loads episodic, relational and spatial adapters based on configuration【F:scripts/train_lora.py†L61-L118】.

**WP2 Replay scheduling integration – PARTIAL**  
Script creates placeholder batch mix but lacks full scheduler integration or dataloaders【F:scripts/train_lora.py†L137-L160】.

**WP3 Hydra configuration & ablations – PARTIAL**  
Config files exist for models and memory modules but limited explicit ablation toggles【F:configs/memory/episodic.yaml†L1-L2】【F:configs/train/default.yaml†L1-L3】.

**WP4 Dry-run training – PARTIAL**  
Unit test confirms dry-run skips dataset load【F:tests/test_training.py†L1-L25】, but executing the script failed due to blocked model download【fec1f7†L1-L49】.

**Gate – NOT MET**  
End-to-end training with ablations and replay scheduling not demonstrated; network failure prevents execution.

### Milestone 8 – Baseline datasets & evaluation runs
**All work packages – NOT MET**  
Only small sample datasets exist; required 50/200/1000 splits and seeds absent【1c6fc2†L1-L2】. No baseline evaluation runs beyond smoke tests【1d6173†L1-L3】; no aggregation script (`report.py`) in repository【be581b†L1-L6】.

**Gate – NOT MET**  
Datasets with checksums, baseline metrics and report are missing.

### Milestone 9 – Memory‑augmented training, evaluation & ablations
**All work packages – NOT MET**  
No recorded experiments under `runs/YYYYMMDD/` demonstrating memory modules or improvements; ablation matrix and reporting absent.

**Gate – NOT MET**  
No experimental runs or aggregated reports showing improvements over baselines.

### Milestone 10 – Research paper & public release
**All work packages – NOT MET**  
No manuscript, release tag or reproduction instructions beyond basic README; search for manuscript references returns only the project plan【c54850†L1-L2】.

**Gate – NOT MET**  
Final manuscript, tagged release and public datasets/reports are missing.

## Findings & Gaps
- **Baseline training wrapper** cannot complete even a dry-run due to blocked HuggingFace model downloads; providing a tiny local model or vendored weights would make smoke tests reliable.
- **Consolidation and replay framework** is entirely absent; implementing scheduler, consolidation worker and maintenance tasks is required to progress beyond prototypes.
- **Integration & ablations** need full replay scheduling, richer Hydra configs and CI tests verifying ablation toggles.
- **Baseline and memory-augmented experiments** along with reporting scripts must be executed and logged as per the evaluation plan.
- **Final publication and release materials** are missing; manuscript drafting and tagging a reproducible release remain outstanding.
