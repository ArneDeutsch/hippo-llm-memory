# Executive Summary

The repository largely implements the HEI‑NW, SGC‑RSS and SMPD prototypes and passes all unit tests and lint checks. Core modules show high test coverage (≥92%) and maintainability, but evaluation harness and FAISS index fall below coverage targets. Mutation testing fails to run due to import path issues. Ready for Milestones M8–M10 once test gaps, coverage deficits and minor ops issues are addressed.

# Design Intent Recap (Authoritative Requirements)
- **Episodic (HEI‑NW)** – k‑WTA sparse keys, FAISS+PQ store, modern‑Hopfield completion, neuromodulated gate *S=α·surprise+β·novelty+γ·reward+δ·pin*, CA2‑like replay, EpisodicAdapter with GQA/FlashAttention (DESIGN §4‑5).
- **Relational (SGC‑RSS)** – tuple extractor, KnowledgeGraph with embeddings, SchemaIndex fast‑track routing, dual‑path retrieval + gated fusion (DESIGN §4‑5).
- **Spatial (SMPD)** – PlaceGraph with optional path integration, A*/Dijkstra planner, MacroLib for behaviour cloning, SpatialAdapter (DESIGN §4‑5).
- **Shared** – Hydra configs & ablations, consolidation worker (50/30/20 mix), nightly maintenance jobs, provenance and rollback (DESIGN §9‑11).

# Findings by Module
## Episodic (HEI‑NW)
- **Data & algorithms**: k‑WTA keys and write gate implemented【F:hippo_mem/episodic/gating.py†L14-L103】; Hopfield completion present【F:hippo_mem/episodic/store.py†L277-L304】.
- **Replay scheduler**: prioritises salience, recency and diversity with gradient‑overlap guard【F:hippo_mem/episodic/replay.py†L15-L118】.
- **Adapter**: cross‑attention with MQA/GQA expansion hooks【F:hippo_mem/episodic/adapter.py†L92-L178】.
- **Verdict**: ✅ core mechanisms present, but write gate lacks explicit δ·pin term (pin bypasses threshold) → ⚠️ noted.

## Relational (SGC‑RSS)
- Tuple extraction and KG with schema fast‑track routing implemented【F:hippo_mem/relational/tuples.py†L23-L73】【F:hippo_mem/relational/kg.py†L16-L122】.
- Dual‑path fusion adapter merges KG and episodic features【F:hippo_mem/relational/adapter.py†L8-L33】.
- **Verdict**: ✅ basic features; KG pruning & GNN updates exist but schema confidence logic simplistic → ⚠️.

## Spatial/Procedural (SMPD)
- Deterministic PlaceGraph with path integration and A*/Dijkstra planners【F:hippo_mem/spatial/map.py†L61-L214】.
- MacroLib stores and ranks macros【F:hippo_mem/spatial/macros.py†L16-L58】; SpatialAdapter supports MQA/GQA【F:hippo_mem/spatial/adapter.py†L29-L94】.
- **Verdict**: ✅ conforms.

## Shared Infrastructure
- Consolidation worker mixes 50/30/20 episodic/semantic/fresh batches【F:hippo_mem/episodic/replay.py†L207-L226】 and schedules maintenance across modules【F:hippo_mem/consolidation/worker.py†L32-L247】.
- Hydra configs cover ablations and efficiency flags (`efficiency.flash_attention`, `episodic.hopfield`, etc.).
- **Ops gaps**: evaluation harness lacks seed‑hash provenance for presets; nightly jobs logging exists but no CI check for log files.

# Test Adequacy
- Coverage summary: core modules ≥90%, scripts `eval_bench.py` 74%, `build_datasets.py` 81% (target ≥70/85). FAISS index at 68%. See `coverage/coverage.json` for details.
- Mutation testing failed: `ModuleNotFoundError` in mutmut run (path issue).
- Missing behaviours: schema mismatch replay weighting, planner optimality property tests, consolidation worker logging under fault conditions. Detailed specs in `TEST_GAPS.md`.

# Static & Maintainability
- Bandit reports only low‑severity issues (asserts in tests, hard‑coded `<eos>` tokens). No high‑risk findings.
- Cyclomatic complexity average A (3.01) with only `ConsolidationWorker.run` at grade B【87742c†L2-L13】. Maintainability index all A【87742c†L14-L33】.

# Runtime & CI Sanity
- Dry‑run training executes with adapters and replay scheduler; FlashAttention gracefully degrades when unavailable【e74699†L1-L9】.
- Evaluation harness runs for baseline presets, producing metrics under `runs/20250816/`【21752b†L1-L3】.
- GitHub Actions workflow `ci.yml` present but last run status not checked.

# Backlog
P0/P1 tasks required before data generation/LoRA training are listed in `TASKS.yaml` (e.g., improve FAISS index coverage, fix mutmut path, add planner optimality tests).

# Appendices
- Commands, environment, coverage artefacts under `coverage/` and `static/` directories.
