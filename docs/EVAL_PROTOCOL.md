# Evaluation Protocol Notes

## Metric selection per suite

- **semantic**: `EM(raw)` is the primary metric. Reports rank presets by `EM(raw)` and include `EM(norm)` alongside for context.
- **other suites**: `EM(norm)` remains the primary metric; `EM(raw)` may be shown as a secondary measure.

See the top-level `EVAL_PROTOCOL.md` for the full protocol.
