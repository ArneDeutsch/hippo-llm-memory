I scanned the repository's `tasks/` and `review/` directories and compared themes to the latest run review.

## Recent `tasks/` files

## Assessment
The current run still shows: missing baseline pre-metrics, stub SGC/SMPD stores, zero gating attempts, and a normalization bug that can hide failures. These are consistent with earlier review themes, suggesting incremental fixes have been applied but **no hard enforcement layer** exists to prevent meaningless runs. The most impactful next step is to add a **preflight gate** plus **CI ablations** so regressions cannot pass unnoticed.
