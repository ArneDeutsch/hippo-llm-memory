# Data

Synthetic datasets generated by `scripts/build_datasets.py` are stored here.

Each file follows the naming scheme `<suite>_<size>_<seed>.jsonl` where:

- `suite` is one of `episodic`, `semantic` or `spatial`.
- `size` is the number of items in the dataset.
- `seed` is the RNG seed used for deterministic generation.

Checksums for all datasets are recorded in `checksums.txt` in the same
folder using the format `<sha256>  <filename>`.

For the spatial suite, `--grid-size` and `--obstacle-density` control the
dimensions of the grid world and the fraction of blocked cells, enabling tests
with walls and repeated macro paths.
