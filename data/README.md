# Data

Synthetic datasets generated by `scripts/build_datasets.py` are stored here.

Each file follows the naming scheme `<suite>_<size>_<seed>.jsonl` where:

- `suite` is one of `episodic`, `semantic` or `spatial`.
- `size` is the number of items in the dataset.
- `seed` is the RNG seed used for deterministic generation.

Episodic variants that include two distractor sentences per story use the
prefix `episodic_d2_` and follow the pattern
`episodic_d2_<size>_<seed>.jsonl`.

Datasets can be regenerated via the CLI.  For example, to create such an
episodic set:

```bash
python scripts/build_datasets.py --suite episodic --size 100 --seed 0 \
  --distractors 2 --out data/episodic_d2_100_0.jsonl
```

`--size` and `--seed` control the number of items and RNG seed respectively,
while `--distractors` sets the number of distractor events preceding the query
for the episodic suite. Episodic records also expose `reward`/`pin` flags to
exercise the neuromodulated write gate.

Checksums for all datasets are recorded in `checksums.txt` in the same
folder using the format `<sha256>  <filename>`.

For the spatial suite, `--grid-size` and `--obstacle-density` control the
dimensions of the grid world and the fraction of blocked cells, enabling tests
with walls, macro paths and sequential trajectories for path integration.
Semantic items include per-fact `schema_fit` labels with a `time` index to
track consolidation speed.
